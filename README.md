ReproZip
========

ReproZip is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator
in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package
that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
command on the author's computational environment (packing step).
A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

For more detailed information, please refer to our [website][web] as well as
our [documentation][docs].

ReproZip is currently being developed at [NYU][nyu]. The team includes:

* [Fernando Chirigati][fc]
* [RÃ©mi Rampin][rr]
* [Dennis Shasha][ds]
* [Juliana Freire][jf]
