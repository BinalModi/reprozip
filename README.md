ReproZip
========

ReproZip is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator
in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package
that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
command on the author's computational environment (packing step).
A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

Quickstart
----------

### Packing

Packing experiments is only available for Linux distributions.
In the environment where the experiment is originally executed, first install reprozip:

    $ pip install reprozip

Then, run your experiment with reprozip.
Suppose you execute your experiment by originally running the following command:

    $ ./myexperiment -my --options inputs/somefile.csv other_file_here.bin

To run it with reprozip, you just need to use the prefix *reprozip trace*:

    $ reprozip trace ./myexperiment -my --options inputs/somefile.csv other_file_here.bin

This command creates a *.reprozip* directory, in which you'll find the configuration file, named *config.yml*.
You can edit the command line and environment variables, and choose which files to pack.

If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, most of these files (library dependencies) are organized by package.
You can add or remove files, or choose not to include a package by changing option *packfiles* from true to false.
In this way, smaller packs can be created with reprozip (if space is an issue), and reprounzip
can download these files from the package manager; however, note this is only available for Debian and Ubuntu for now,
and also be aware that package versions might differ.
Choosing which files to pack is also important to remove sensitive information and third-party software that is
not open source and should not be distributed.
          
Once done editing the configuration file (or even if you did not change anything), run the following command
to create a ReproZip package named *my_experiment*:

    $ reprozip pack my_experiment.rpz

Voil&agrave;! Now your experiment has been packed, and you can send it to your collaborators,
reviewers, and researchers around the world!
          
Note that you can open the help message for any reprozip command
by using the flag *-h*.

### Unpacking

Do you need to unpack an experiment in a Linux machine? Easy! First, install reprounzip:

    $ pip install reprounzip

Then, if you want to unpack everything in a single directory named *mydirectory*
and execute the experiment from there, use the prefix *reprounzip directory*:

    $ reprounzip directory setup mydirectory --pack my_experiment.rpz</br>
    $ reprounzip directory run mydirectory

In case you prefer to build a chroot environment under *mychroot*,
use the prefix *reprounzip chroot*:

    $ reprounzip chroot setup mychroot --pack my_experiment.rpz</br>
    $ reprounzip chroot run mychroot

Note that the previous options do not interfere with the original configuration of
the environment, so don't worry!
If you are using Debian or Ubuntu,
reprounzip also has an option to install all the library
dependencies directly on the machine using package managers
(rather than just copying the files from the .rpz package).
Be aware that this will interfere in your environment and it may
update your library packages, so use it at your own risk! For this option,
just use the prefix *reprounzip installpkgs*:

    $ reprounzip installpkgs my_experiment.rpz

What if you want to reproduce the experiment in Windows or Mac OS X?
You can build a virtual machine with the experiment! Easy as well!
First, install the plugin reprounzip-vagrant:

    $ pip install reprounzip-vagrant

Note that (i) you must install reprounzip first, and (ii) the plugin requires having
[Vagrant][vagrant] installed.
Then, use the prefix *reprounzip vagrant* to create and start a virtual machine
under directory *mytemplate*:

    $ reprounzip vagrant setup mytemplate --pack my_experiment.rpz

To execute the experiment, simply run:

    $ reprounzip vagrant run mytemplate

Alternatively, you may use [Docker][docker]
containers to reproduce the experiment, which also works under
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows! First, install the plugin reprounzip-docker:

    $ pip install reprounzip-docker

Then, assuming that you want to create the container under directory *mytemplate*,
simply use the prefix *reprounzip docker*:

    $ reprounzip docker setup mytemplate --pack my_experiment.rpz</br>
    $ reprounzip docker run mytemplate
          
Remember that you can open the help message and learn more about other available flags and options
by using the flag *-h* for any reprounzip command.
