..  _unpacked-format:

Internal format of unpacked experiments
***************************************

While *reprounzip* is designed to allow users to reproduce an experiment without having to master the tool used to run it (e.g. vagrant, docker): the unpacker drives it automatically. However, in some situations it might be useful to go behind the scenes and interact with the unpacked experiment directly. This page describes how the various unpackers operate.

Note that future versions of unpackers might work in a different way. No attempt is made to make unpacked experiments compatible across different versions of *reprounzip*.
